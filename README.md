## Introduction 
I have chosen to make my first 'milestone' project a health and fitness website for a gymnasium establishment. 
As somebody who regularly attends a gym, i hope this passion and natural interest will help better the level of content i am able to produce 
for this website. 

This is my first comprehensive 'Readme' document using the markdown language. 
i will attempt to add as much detail prior to the project and update as the project progresses.

## Design 

## Logo 

As currently unfamiliar with image design applications i seeked assistance for a basic .png Logo with a transparent background from ChatGPT
i requested a modern style, featuring either dumbbells or a lightning bolt for a gym called 'Power House' with an electric blue colour. 
i amended the logo with an orange border and gained a second logo with the colours reveresed.

## Colors 

After saving the logo to my project folder, i obtained the hash color code #0197FE
with this primary colour i used some of my design knowledge of 'Complementary colours' which i gained from completing a 'level 2 Graphic Design course.
i googled searched and found a online color wheel website called 'www.canva.com'


Here i discovered the perfect complimentary colour for my primary blue is a orange colour as seen on the image below.
