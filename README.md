## POWER HOUSE 
### By Gary Hird 
### 3rd of July 2025 (MileStone Project 1)

## Introduction 
I have chosen to make my first 'milestone' project a health and fitness website for a gymnasium establishment. 
As somebody who regularly attends a gym, i hope this passion and natural interest will help better the level of content i am able to produce for this website. 

This is my first comprehensive 'Readme' document using the markdown language. 
i will attempt to add as much detail prior to the project and update as the project progresses.

    Not addressing this warning as lorem ipsum text is just used as temporary design filler

Caused by converting a model open button to a 'a href link'
